In no case shall the bulk of the hair interfere with the proper wearing of uniform headgear. If a beard or mustache is worn, it shall be well groomed and neatly trimmed at all times in order not to present a ragged appearance. Full and partial beards are authorized, but patchy, spotty clumps of facial hair are not considered beards and as such are not permitted. The bulk of the beard (distance that the mass of facial hair protrudes from the skin of the face) shall not exceed one-half an inch. The length of the individual facial hair shall be limited to three quarters of an inch. No portion of any mustache will extend below the lipline of the upper lip. Police officers, while in uniform, shall not wear earrings or ear-studs; nose-studs; or any type of necklace chain or medallion outside of a uniform shirt, blouse or jacket.
