IAD2014-0265,,Citizen complaint,2014-06-12,,"At 11:45AM on Thursday, 6/12/14, I was notified by Officer Willie Lyons that two females were at the B2 front desk who wished to make a complaint about two Police Officers.  The complainant stated that at 9AM on this date, she had just put her son on the bus at Ruggles St and Shawmut Ave, when she was approached by two unknown Police Officers.  She stated that they showed her a photograph of a wanted person and accused her of being that person.  She further stated that she was afraid and that they yelled at her.  She described the Officers as white males, one about 5'10 185lbs with blue eyes.  She further stated that they had Boston Police badges, #438 and #483.  She futher stated that they were driving a maroon unmarked vehicle.  She stated that the interaction lasted about 20 minutes, and that she was never placed in handcuffs and she was not frisked or searched.  She also stated that she did not have any identification on her at the time.  She then called her mother on the phone, but the Officers refused to speak to her.  Her motherwas extremely irate and was unwilling to listen to my explanation of the complaint process.  She demanded a copy of a report, and I informed her that there would be an internal report that she was not allowed to have at that time.  I also handed her a form from the front desk, ""Commendation or Complaint Resolution Procedure"", and encouraged her to read it.  She also demanded to know the names of the Officers involved.  I went back inside to the Duty Supervisor desk and learned that the BK02D was assigned to Officers Kevin Coakley and Mary Rooney, and that they had called off at Roxbury Court at 8:53.  When I informed the complainant that I did not believe the Officers worked out of B2, she became even more angry and stated ""I know you know their names, you can find out from their badge numbers.""  I informed her that I could not find out their names from their badge numbers, but that an investigation would proceed and most likely identify them.  Both women then left the station, and one of the complainants called me a ""fucking asshole.""  This interaction was partially witnessed by Officers Willie Lyons, Roger Burke, and civilian employee Mary Goodwyn.",Unknown,,,Respectful Treatment,Not Sustained,2014-12-19,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IAD2014-0267,,Citizen complaint,2014-06-13,,"Let me start by saying I owe a commendation to every Boston police officer I have ever met until today. Every encounter had been one which validated the respect I have for the police and fire. I am the daughter, sister, aunt and cousin of police officers, former police officer, and a late police officer. I have a met community officer who was such a good communicator and so serious about her work that she would make a wonderful CEO. So you can understand my disappointment at the experience I had today. I was walking on Boston Street and had just crossed the expressway. I passed the Polish American club and noticed a man on the tiny space in front of the front door to a building. He was on his back, in physical stress of some type. He appeared to be under some kind of influence. I was on the phone with a friend, and trying to figure out what to do when I saw a squad car going towards Mass Ave as I was. I tried to motion to them, and crossed the street in front of their car, ( in front of DJ's) holding my hand up to catch their attention. They looked at me and kept driving, I called out hey, and the passenger officer appeared to pull the cell away from his ear and yelled ""What?"". Then they continued to drive away. Other pedestrians crossed the street and I explained why I had been trying to catch their attention. They thought that was what I was doing as well. I asked if the man was still lying in front of the front door to the building, and they said no. I don't know why the squad didn't stop or drive around the block. I only know that the incident saddened me. Thank you to every officer I have met in Boston who did stop, who did listen, and who continue to. I wonder how those officers would feel if a family member of theirs tried to catch the attention of an officer and was treated that way.",Unknown,Police Officer,,Neg.Duty/Unreasonable Judge,Not Sustained,2014-07-14,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I quickly went over to the door and asked ""who is it?"" no reply. Thinking that it was one of my roommates that forgot his keys, I pulled the door open all the way. There in front of the door were several men most dressed in dark attire with bullet proof vests, one was carrying some kind of a shield. The man at the front wore shorts, red sox baseball cap, and a dark t-shirt, his badge was not visible. He asked if he could come in. I replied no you may not. I inquired about their business to which the man at the door whom I would later come to know as officer Michael Brown of the Boston Police Fugitive Unit stated they were looking for my brother and someone told them he was here. I asked who gave them that information. They did not reply. They asked if anyone other than myself was here. I said I am the only one here at the moment. Again and again they asked if they could come in and my answer was the same and I have advise them several times that if they wanted to come in here they could get a warrant from the court. I also stated I would not let men dressed in military attire into my apartment and that I needed to see a Worcester Police officer, men in blue. I have roommates and did not want any issues. I then heard someone say ""we can go in."" They cornered me by the door and one officer interlocked my arms behind my back. I asked, ""Am I being detained?"" They ignored me. I told them over and over as they were going through my apartment that this was unconstitutional and they were corrupt officers. One officer (tall bulky Caucasian male) stated, ""we care about our safety first."" I retorted, you were safe outside the door. Then another replied you do not know your rights. I retorted again, you need a warrant or probable cause to search a dwelling, they had none. The was no audio in the apartment except for my voice, the officers and my phone was still on the kitchen table playing the speech. I heard one of the officers mumbling ""we heard something"" as a justification on why they just entered my apartment illegally. I don't think that is sufficient reason to come in when again there was no noise other then the previously mentioned voices. The search took no more than two minutes. To not leave out Sgt. Supernx, he was standing to my left and trying to ask me questions as the other officer (un-named) held my hands crossed behind my back. Sgt. Supernx and officer Brown were taking turns asking me questions. I did not answer any more questions but instead vented out on how they were infringing on my rights as a citizen. You cannot walk into a home because you hear noise. I told them the noise (talking) could be from a TV, Radio or in my case my phone. That is not probable cause. I asked the officer several times to leave my apartment, they did not leave even after their search was completed, they instead hung around to ask more question.

The officer then blows past us without even noticing. A few of the cars honked at her in disbelief. I was shocked and very upset by this ( and the kids were scared).

IAD2014-0455,,Citizen complaint,2014-09-12,,"While attempting to make a left turn into the driveway of The Carruth building, I was sitting and waiting for an opening in the traffic to complete the turn. While I was waiting, a police officer working near the intersection knocked on the passenger-side window. I had a passenger in the car, and my passenger lowered the window. The officer immediately started yelling into the car to the point that I could not ask a question about what the problem was. He finally yelled something to the effect of 'you can't turn here, you're blocking traffic and the bus can't move'. As I live in the building and know that the turn I was making was into the driveway of the parking garage, I knew I was making an appropriate turn. I believe the problem was that the bus leaving Ashmont station pulled out behind me and was blocking traffic in both directions. The police officer never spoke calmly and really scared the passenger in the car and me. There was no need to yell and scream when he could have simply explained the traffic problem and asked me to continue up Dorchester Avenue and turn around to come back to the driveway. My passenger was very upset, as was I. I asked the officer for his badge number, and he just walked off. By the time I parked the car in the garage and went outside to obtain his badge or car information, the officer was gone. BPD has enough issues related to negative publicity, and I would hope my interaction with this officer is not what the majority of our citizens encounter. It was disturbing and unnecessary. Thank you.",Unknown,Police Officer,,Respectful Treatment,Not Sustained,2017-01-03,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IAD2014-0504,,Citizen complaint,2014-10-14,,"While approaching a crosswalk and waiting traffic refused to slow or stop for me. After 10 seconds more people arrived to cross on crosswalk. Traffic refused to walk across... for at least (3) min. I was already late to pick up my grandmothers prescriptions from CVS as she was soon to be in need at her age of 82.  I had had enough and walked out anyway so others followed me... We were nearly struck by a regular speeding vehicle and a taxi cab. Feeling the need to do the right thing, I saw the marked cruiser with an officer (male) inside using the cell phone. I waved at him in a respectful manner, he not only fai8led to put down his I-Phone but he only looked towards me half way and said ""what - can I help you???"" The officer wouldn't even down his window but continued talking on the IPhone causing me to feel disrespected and ignored. I asked him if he would roll the window down so we can speak regarding a complaint but he ignored and went back to speaking on the ell phone. I returned back to the cruiser to write down the plate # with my cell phones ""memo pad"" and he even ignored that. After racing to Area A with the complaint, the supervisor informed his desk duty civilian officer that he's not only available but to ignore him. Unaware that I over heard his demand, I was given this form then told by the on duty agent that I was angry today, I wanted relief today so another officer stepped in but he was nice. He apologized but told me that copley is (word not legible) jurisdiction of the south end. He offered to accept it but that would delay the process.",Unknown,Police Officer,,Neg.Duty/Unreasonable Judge,Not Sustained,2015-04-16,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IAD2014-0544,,Citizen complaint,2014-11-14,,"On Friday, November 7, 2014 our property was canvassed by two men from ""Just Energy"" from mid-afternoon until the evening. They were representing that they were in some way affiliated with  ""the electric utility"" and were on our property to ""check our bills for errors"". They indicated that they were on official business and were not solicitors. They insisted on seeing copies of our electric bills. Having heard of them before and recalling that they were claiming to be a shady company that tricks people into changing their electrical energy supplier to Just Energy, several trustees including myself and homeowners told them to leave our property. They refused, claiming they were on ""official utility business"" and holding up their plastic badges.  Trustee, called 9-1-1 after 7 pm and reported that these people were on our property and would not leave despite our direction to them to do so, and that ""Just Energy"" was a scam operation. The dispatcher said Just Energy was a ""legitimate company"" and there was nothing the police could do. She refused to dispatch an officer to our address, repeating several times that they were a ""legitimate company"".  The Boston Police Department's own Facebook page has a discussion of ""Just Energy"" and the BPD warns persons ""should you encounter an individual claiming to be from Just Energy, please notify Boston POlice."" So you can imagine our surprise when the police dispatcher blew off the call and would not dispatch an officer. The Trustees of Washingtonian Court Condominium wish to lodge a complaint for disregard of a call for assistance when we could not gt these misleading solicitors to leave our private property. We continuously encourage our owners and residents to be vigilant and not to hisitate to call the police if something is amiss on our property. In this case we had several owners and Trustees attempting unsuccessfully to get these ""Just Energy"" solicitors to leave our property, and we were met with a cold shoulder when we call 9-1-1 for assistance. Should we be telling our owners not to call the police but t take matters into their own hands in the future? We hope that is not the message you are trying to convey.",Unknown,,,Neg.Duty/Unreasonable Judge,Pending,,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 50-ish year old white male officer, uniformed and wearing a fluorescent yellow Boston Police jacket approached me and referred to me as his ""Future ex-wife"" in front of many people. Clearly, he thought this was funny. However, I am not only much younger than him, but I am also not a commodity in the way he referred to me. I have never had such negative experiences with impolite police as I have in the city of Boston and it breaks my heart to say that.

I called the police station almost everyday that week to follow up and left several messages for the auto theft detective at the number that they finally did give to me when I found out from a friend that there was someone who handles car thefts. I never received a call back from him. I also called the tow line several times that week and was finally told to stop calling since the plate was in their system as stolen so someone would call me if and when it turned up. I stopped calling, but I continued to check the online plate look-up for the Boston tow lot.

IAD2014-0270,,Citizen complaint,2014-06-13,,"I am writing regarding an incident dated . On in Dorchester court my father  was giving a 1 year stay away restraining order against me due to threats he made against me as well as for a false restraining order he obtained against me which expired may 4h 2014. Because of the nature of the threats, the false restraining order, and his abuse of my elderly grandfather, part of the restraining order stated that was to immediately vacate the residence . After I went back to have the order extended for a year he didn't show up for the hearing because of a criminal warrant he had out for his arrest. I told the judge that he still hadn't vacated the home even after the restraining order and the judge advised me to call 911 when he was there and to bring the police on the scene a copy of the restraining order. In a 1-month span I received numerous phone calls from neighbors on the street concerned about him still living there and abusing my grandfather(taking his $$ meds, trying to get me put off the will, etc.). My father just recently moved in a year ago after spending 20 years in jail on and off because of drug use and other issues. I thought I would be helping him by allowing him to move to Boston ad get good job and be w/ family. On the above date I received a call that my father was at the home and my girlfriend had dropped off a copy of the key to the house on the porch. previously the police and said they had went to the house but nobody would open the door, so I alerted the dispatcher to the key on the porch if the officers needed to get in to remove him. After about 5 minutes, I received a call from the police dispatcher sating that I needed to go to the scene and talk to the officers to have my father removed. I explained that I didn't have a copy of the restraining order on me but she said it would show up in the system. When I arrived on the scene both my granddad and father were outside talking to police. As I pulled over to talk to the police I was asked by the officers ""why I was there when I and a restraining order against me?"". I calmly explained to them to reality of the situation and that I had called about my father and the court order that he leave the house immediately. I also told the officers to talk to the dispatcher who had sent me to the scene. The main officer Danroy, was immediately dismissive of my claims and extremely disrespectful and unprofessional. I then called the dispatcher back and put it on speaker to confirm that she had told me to come and that my Fathers restraining order was in the system. officer Danroy wouldn't allow any of the other two officers to speak  to me or the dispatcher and refused to even look up my fathers name. If he had pulled up my fathers name then he would have not only saw the restraining order but the active warrant my father had. Officer Danroy then ordered me out the car and made me walk with him to the front of the house so he could then arrest me for violating the restraining order, because otherwise where I was I was over 500 yards from the house. In addition this disgusting piece of shit officer and worthless human being then had my car towed for no reason even thru I had an active license, and the car was parked legally in a parking spot. He called the car rental company and said they were towing the car for drug related offenses , which he knew would cause them to not release my vehicle which I had rented for work purposes. In addition he stole out of my trunk over $800 of goods, including 2 boxes valued at$200 each and a gold chain valued @$400.00. I had to spend the night in jail, miss work and when I got to court it was found that I was correct, that my dad was in violation of the order, and was was released from custody while my father was taking into custody from the courtroom for his active warrants. At this point I want to be completely reimbursed for the theft by officer Danroy and him severely reprimanded or removed from he police force. Ii work very closely with police, both from c-11 and B-3 as well as Transit police as a facilitator for the YWCA's youth/police dialogue. I work hard to rebuild the trust of police of the youth and others in the greater Boston community, and promote BPS as a police force dedicated to the community. It seems that these good deeds have been returned with punishment. I asked that Officer Danroy be sanctioned so severely because the BPS is too good of an organization top allow a piece of shit worthless human being stain their name and put all, honest officers at risk and left w/ a bad name in the community.","Grant,Donroy G",Police Officer,4070,Conformance to Laws,Unfounded,2015-02-20,"",false,96545,"Grant, Donroy G",,Police Officer,2006-11-27,4070,02122,Boston,MA,Dorchester,0.00,0.00,14295.50,0.00,20762.29,0.00,4152.48,39210.27,,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,5,8,16,3,66,8,0,0,27,1,,,,,https://www.wokewindows.org/officers/96545-donroy-g-grant

On the above date I received a call that my father was at the home and my girlfriend had dropped off a copy of the key to the house on the porch. previously the police and said they had went to the house but nobody would open the door, so I alerted the dispatcher to the key on the porch if the officers needed to get in to remove him. After about 5 minutes, I received a call from the police dispatcher sating that I needed to go to the scene and talk to the officers to have my father removed. I explained that I didn't have a copy of the restraining order on me but she said it would show up in the system. When I arrived on the scene both my granddad and father were outside talking to police. As I pulled over to talk to the police I was asked by the officers ""why I was there when I and a restraining order against me?"". I calmly explained to them to reality of the situation and that I had called about my father and the court order that he leave the house immediately. I also told the officers to talk to the dispatcher who had sent me to the scene. The main officer Danroy, was immediately dismissive of my claims and extremely disrespectful and unprofessional. I then called the dispatcher back and put it on speaker to confirm that she had told me to come and that my Fathers restraining order was in the system. officer Danroy wouldn't allow any of the other two officers to speak  to me or the dispatcher and refused to even look up my fathers name. If he had pulled up my fathers name then he would have not only saw the restraining order but the active warrant my father had. Officer Danroy then ordered me out the car and made me walk with him to the front of the house so he could then arrest me for violating the restraining order, because otherwise where I was I was over 500 yards from the house. In addition this disgusting piece of shit officer and worthless human being then had my car towed for no reason even thru I had an active license, and the car was parked legally in a parking spot. He called the car rental company and said they were towing the car for drug related offenses , which he knew would cause them to not release my vehicle which I had rented for work purposes. In addition he stole out of my trunk over $800 of goods, including 2 boxes valued at$200 each and a gold chain valued @$400.00. I had to spend the night in jail, miss work and when I got to court it was found that I was correct, that my dad was in violation of the order, and was was released from custody while my father was taking into custody from the courtroom for his active warrants. At this point I want to be completely reimbursed for the theft by officer Danroy and him severely reprimanded or removed from he police force. Ii work very closely with police, both from c-11 and B-3 as well as Transit police as a facilitator for the YWCA's youth/police dialogue. I work hard to rebuild the trust of police of the youth and others in the greater Boston community, and promote BPS as a police force dedicated to the community. It seems that these good deeds have been returned with punishment. I asked that Officer Danroy be sanctioned so severely because the BPS is too good of an organization top allow a piece of shit worthless human being stain their name and put all, honest officers at risk and left w/ a bad name in the community.","Grant,Donroy G",Police Officer,4070,Respectful Treatment,Unfounded,2015-02-20,"",false,96545,"Grant, Donroy G",,Police Officer,2006-11-27,4070,02122,Boston,MA,Dorchester,0.00,0.00,14295.50,0.00,20762.29,0.00,4152.48,39210.27,,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,5,8,16,3,66,8,0,0,27,1,,,,,https://www.wokewindows.org/officers/96545-donroy-g-grant

IAD2014-0378,,Citizen complaint,2014-08-04,,"Complaint - I was driving toward downtown on Seaport Blvd this morning and intended to turn right onto Sleeper Street where I was taking a friend from out of town for lunch at Sam's. When I got to Sleeper Street I pulled over to the right because the street was blocked off and I wasn't sure how to reroute; I was trying to get my bearings. Less than a minute later a livery car came down Sleeper Street from the other direction and hit pedestrians less than 10 feet in front of me. The woman was hit with the front of his car, and the man was hit with his side mirror on the left. I pulled over even further to ask them how they were as the woman was clearly shaken, but they insisted she was okay and walked away. Since I could no longer back up onto Seaport, I continued down the blocked off street. I was immediate met by a cop at the corner of Northern Ave and Seaport Blvd who pulled me over. Before I'd even opened my mouth he was rude, condescending and aggressive. I tried politely and calmly to explain what happened but he yelled at me to hand over my license and registration and would not listen. He insisted he was ""watching me"". He walked away, writing down my info on a piece of paper. When he returned I again tried to explain the situation and he yelled at me that nobody was hit by a car, he was watching me, and ""tell it to a judge."" 'LEAVE."" I tried again to say politely (using sir and extremely calm and respectful) that my friend in the car saw the accident and someone was hit and ask what was going to happen (he handed me nothing) and he said I'd get a ticket in the mail. I asked what kind of ticket since I had nothing to take with me and he said CITATION (emphasized as if I was a complete idiot). He again yelled for me to leave and walked away as I tried to get his name and badge number.","O'Hara,William J Jr",Police Officer,4081,Respectful Treatment,Sustained,2014-11-09,Oral Reprimand,false,9779,"O'Hara, William J Jr",,Police Officer,1986-11-24,4081,02128,Boston,MA,East Boston,356.99,0.00,31050.33,0.00,5164.63,0.00,0.00,35857.97,,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,4,5,4,7,4,0,0,164,2,,,,,https://www.wokewindows.org/officers/9779-william-j-jr-o-hara

I had had enough and walked out anyway so others followed me... We were nearly struck by a regular speeding vehicle and a taxi cab. Feeling the need to do the right thing, I saw the marked cruiser with an officer (male) inside using the cell phone. I waved at him in a respectful manner, he not only fai8led to put down his I-Phone but he only looked towards me half way and said ""what - can I help you???"" The officer wouldn't even down his window but continued talking on the IPhone causing me to feel disrespected and ignored. I asked him if he would roll the window down so we can speak regarding a complaint but he ignored and went back to speaking on the ell phone. I returned back to the cruiser to write down the plate # with my cell phones ""memo pad"" and he even ignored that. After racing to Area A with the complaint, the supervisor informed his desk duty civilian officer that he's not only available but to ignore him.

I met all of you guys on different occasion and I have pictures of each one of you with myself and my son .

I did stop but that I will have my day in court and it's to defend myself and that is not the issue in hand. The events that lead up to the ticket was the most Civil Right Violation I have ever seen in all my life as a resident in Boston. Officer 9279 approached my car and ask me for my license and registration which I handed it to him and then I asked him why are you stopping me and he just ignore me. I had to ask him several times why was he stopping me and he finally said in a rude manner because you failed to stop at the stop sign. During the ticket writing process this officer than started speaking /waving to people as they passed by in their cars. He then started to pace back in forth between the three cars he stopped I then watch him drop my license on the ground and step on it I wasn't sure if he did it by accident, so I said ""excuse me you drop my license on the ground "" and he then turn and look at me and walk back over it with his shoe.
