                        If pulled over as a driver, you must identify yourself upon request. Passengers do not have to, unless the officer is issuing them a citation. Keep your seatbelt on.

If the latter is true, you have the right to walk away. Do not run or draw attention to yourself while doing so.

                    <summary>Neglect of Duty/Unreasonable Judgment</summary>
                This includes any condcut or omission which is not in accordance with established and ordinary duties or procedures as to such employees or which constitutes use of unreasonable judgment in the exercising of any discretion granted to an employee. [Rule 102 Section 04]

                    <summary>Respectful Treatment</summary>
                    Employees shall, on all occasions, be civil and respectful, curteous and considerate toward their supervisors, their subordinates and all other members of the Department and the general public. No employee shall use epithets or terms that tend to denigrate any person(s) due to their race, color, creed, gender identity or sexual orientation except when necessary in police reports or in testimony.

                    <summary>Use of Force</summary>
                    Force is defined by the BPD as "the amount of physical effort, however slight, required by police to compel compliance by an unwilling individual." This definition has since become a lot more complex.

Condcut unbecoming an employee shall include that which tends to indicate that the employee is unable or unfit to continue as a member of the Department, or tends to impair the operation of the Department or its employees.
