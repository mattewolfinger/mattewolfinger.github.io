            <h1>YOUR RIGHTS</h1>
            <aside>While interacting with the police in Massachusetts, it's important to know the rights you possess as a citizen. It shouldn't be up to you to stay calm and de-escalate, but the reality of that situation isn't so forgiving. As long as police bruality and misconduct remain an issue, we must remain vigilant and informed to avoid the potential repricussions from officers with a lack of sufficient training.</aside>
