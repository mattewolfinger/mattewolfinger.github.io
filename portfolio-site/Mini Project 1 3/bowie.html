    <p class="explanation">
        This analysis and subsequent visualization (created using JavaScript's D3 library) came to be after a careful examination of the <b>"18,393 Pitchfork Reviews"</b> data set used for my previous mini projects — courtesy of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data">Nolan Conaway on Kaggle</a>. The data set catalogues reviews by online music publication <a href="https://pitchfork.com/"><i>Pitchfork</i></a> ranging from <b>January 5, 1999 through January 8, 2017</b>. Instead of focusing on all of the reviews in the data set, I thought it might be a bit more interesting to focus on one specific artist. Before, I had opted for David Bowie as his albums were easy to manually input. As we are now loading our data using D3 as a .csv file, I thought keeping the artist from the previous mini project would make things simpler. While assembling these data, I figured it might be a bit more interesting to go beyond Conaway's range (which ended in January of 2017) and add on the <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/">David Bowie albums <i>Pitchfork</i> has reviewed since</a>. I manually inserted new variables for albums up to the year 2020 by going to their website and cataloguing the additional albums one by one. Since there's a chronological order to these data (as the x-axis is a measure of time), the intent of the visualization and analysis is to showcase whether or not Bowie's later albums received more negative scores by critics than his early work.

        This scatter plot is fairly similar to the one previously constructed, only now the interactivity and filtering elements are added to make the message more cohesive. I thought it would initially be interesting to allow for a filtering of posthumous reviews after Bowie's death in January of 2016, in order to determine if the overall scores became more favorable following his passing. After discovering this would provide a very underwhelming and narrow narrative, I opted against it. Instead, I sorted these reviews into categories based off of the decade of the album's initial release. This stretched across seven decades, starting during the 1960s and ending with the 2020s. The filtering became a bit awkward, but the resulting code provided the intended result, so out of concern of losing what I had achieved, I opted to leave some of the CSS/JavaScript code a bit disjointed. Hovering over the checkbox will highlight the scatterplot points corresponding to that category, and clicking the blue checkbox will make those vanish. Clicking it again brings things back to normal.

        I also thought it would be nice to work with the tooltip elements we had been experimenting with. I have a habit of getting a bit too ambitious, so I had to control those perfectionist tendencies and go with something I knew would function at a basic level for the user. Hovering over each point on the scatter plot will fill its opacity the full way, making its selection feel a bit more responsive and real. The tooltip pop-up displays the information I felt was necessary — that being the name of the album, the year of that album's release and the out of 10 score it received by the <i>Pitchfork</i> critic. I've always viewed pop-ups like this as avenues to pursue further information at the behest of the reader, so this bit of additional info could be valuable to those wishing to obtain a more specified narrative.
