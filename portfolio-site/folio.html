<p class="preface_text">Matt Wolfinger is a data reporter and graduate of Northeastern University's journalism master's program. His studies helped him accumulate the necessary skills to become a fierce competitor in the industry while learning multiple coding languages and libraries. As a reporter, he's passionate about highlighting systemic issues and giving a voice to marginalized communities â€” letting data serve as a tool for advocacy while seeking to improve the public's capacity for data literacy to combat the fervent issue of disinformation.<br>

<br>While at <em>Denver Business Journal</em>, Matt was the newsroom's sole data reporter and covered the cannabis beat. Living in Boston, they conducted on-the-ground reporting at numerous protests and demonstrations, interviewing workers who expressed frustration over union-busting practices utilized by their employers.<br>

<br>Their reporting on protests organized by Starbucks and local coffee shop employees was featured in Best of SNO. Matt's writing has appeared in <em>Denver Business Journal, The Scope, ConsumerAffairs, Storybench</em>, and more.</p>
